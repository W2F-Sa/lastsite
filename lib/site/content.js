      "Five years of writing release notes for production services taught me three things. None of them are about Markdown.",
    body: `
<p>I've written release notes for the same internal platform for five years. The format has changed about a dozen times. The latest one stuck because I finally stopped optimising for the wrong audience.</p>
<h2>1. Write for the person who hasn't shipped a change in six months</h2>
<p>Most readers of a changelog aren't reading every release. They're catching up. The version bump itself is irrelevant — what they want is "what does this mean for what I'm doing today?" Write each entry so it can be read in isolation.</p>
<h2>2. Lead with the verb</h2>
<p>"Added", "Removed", "Fixed", "Renamed". The verb tells the reader whether they should care, before they read the rest of the line. I've watched skim-readers parse fifty changelog entries in the time it took to make their coffee — that only works if the first word does the work.</p>
<h2>3. Group by user, not by package</h2>
<p>Internal release notes used to be grouped by which package changed. That made sense to the engineer publishing the release and to nobody else. We now group by which surface a user touches: dashboard, CLI, API, deploy. The grouping changed who reads the changelog.</p>
<h2>What about Keep a Changelog?</h2>
<p>Fine as a starting template. The "Unreleased" header at the top is the trick that actually moves the needle — when adding an entry is a one-line edit on every PR, people add entries.</p>
<p>Everything else — emoji, semver discipline, contributor attribution — is texture. If you don't have the three above, the texture doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I keep starting new Go services. They keep being mostly the same. After enough rounds I made a checklist, and now every service starts with these decisions already settled. None of them are clever. That's the point.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>One module, one binary.</strong> Not a monorepo with sub-modules. Not a "shared lib" pulled in from a sibling repo. One <code>go.mod</code>, one <code>cmd/server</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><code>log/slog</code>, not zap, not zerolog.</strong> The standard library is good enough now. The handler is the only piece worth customising.</li>
  <li><strong>Config via env vars, parsed once at startup.</strong> No hot-reload. If you need different config, restart the process.</li>
  <li><strong>Health checks: <code>/livez</code> always returns 200, <code>/readyz</code> reflects real dependencies.</strong> Don't conflate them.</li>
  <li><strong>Graceful shutdown with a deadline.</strong> <code>context.WithTimeout</code> on <code>http.Server.Shutdown</code>. If you can't drain in 30s, you have bigger problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics over logs for hot paths.</strong> Logs are for events. Metrics are for rates. Don't log every request.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest is just business logic. Most outages I've shipped came from the parts I tried to make clever. Nothing on this list is clever.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Yes, it still works. No, you don't need Redis. Here's what broke, what didn't, and the one knob I wish I'd turned earlier.",
    body: `
<p>Three years ago I replaced a Redis-backed worker queue with a single SQLite table and a five-line "claim a job" query. The whole migration took an afternoon. I've been quietly waiting for it to fall over ever since.</p>
<p>It hasn't.</p>
<h2>The schema</h2>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE jobs (
  id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  kind    TEXT NOT NULL,
  payload BLOB NOT NULL,
  state   TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  run_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  claimed_by TEXT,
  attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
CREATE INDEX jobs_pickup ON jobs(state, run_at);</code></pre>
<h2>The claim</h2>
<pre><code>UPDATE jobs SET state='running', claimed_by=?
WHERE id = (
  SELECT id FROM jobs
  WHERE state='pending' AND run_at &lt;= unixepoch()
  ORDER BY run_at LIMIT 1
)
RETURNING *;</code></pre>
<p>That's the whole queue. WAL mode, a single writer, however many readers you want.</p>
<h2>The one knob</h2>
<p>The thing I wish I'd done earlier was set <code>PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000</code> on every connection. Without it, the moment two workers race the claim query you get <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> and one of them retries instantly, which makes the contention worse. With it, the engine just waits, and throughput stops being spiky.</p>
<h2>When this stops being enough</h2>
<p>If you're past ~500 jobs/sec sustained or your jobs are large blobs, switch to something built for the job. Below that, the answer is almost always "just use SQLite and stop reading hacker news."</p>

      "I stopped trying to be clever with traits and Pin and life got better. A short reflection on six months of writing async Rust for a living.",
    body: `
<p>I spent the first three months of my last contract fighting the type system. The next three I spent un-fighting it. Almost every async Rust mistake I've made traces back to the same root cause: I tried to express something polymorphically when a concrete type would have been fine.</p>
<h2>Things I stopped doing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Returning <code>impl Future&lt;Output = ...&gt;</code> from trait methods unless I really needed dyn dispatch. <code>async fn</code> in traits is fine now.</li>
  <li>Wrapping everything in <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> by default. Nine times out of ten the right answer is to give the value to one task and message it.</li>
  <li>Reaching for <code>tokio::select!</code> when a plain <code>tokio::join!</code> works. Cancellation safety is harder than it looks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things I started doing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using <code>tokio::task::JoinSet</code> for fan-out. It owns the handles and cleans up on drop. Stop hand-rolling vectors of <code>JoinHandle</code>.</li>
  <li>Passing channels around instead of locks. <code>tokio::sync::mpsc</code> is the answer to surprisingly many shared-state questions.</li>
  <li>Writing the synchronous version first, even if it's a unit test. If I can't model the data flow without async I'll never untangle it with async.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is novel. It's just the advice I wish someone had repeated to me until I listened.</p>

<p>I keep a small text file called <code>opinions.md</code> in my dotfiles. Every December I diff it against last year's copy. Here's what moved in 2024.</p>
<h2>"Monorepos are always worth it."</h2>
<p>I still like monorepos for tightly coupled services. I no longer think they're the default. The cost of build tooling and CI complexity is real, and most three-person teams don't have the bandwidth to absorb it.</p>
<h2>"You should always write integration tests against a real database."</h2>
<p>Mostly true, but I now reach for testcontainers <em>and</em> a fast in-memory fake. The fake catches 80% of bugs in milliseconds. The container catches the rest in seconds. Don't pick one.</p>
<h2>"Static typing always pays for itself."</h2>
<p>Still my default. But I've watched smart teams ship faster in dynamic languages by skipping the modelling phase entirely, and I no longer believe the productivity gap goes the way I assumed.</p>
<h2>"Self-hosting is character building."</h2>
<p>Replaced my self-hosted email server with a paid provider this summer. My weekends came back. Character is overrated.</p>
